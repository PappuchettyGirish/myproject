Developed a website where users can sign up but login only after the approval of administrator. After
user has logged in, they can change their profile picture and find the friends after searching from the list of users
available in the website. Users can send the friend requests and accept or reject the friend requests. Once both
became friends they can send messages to each other. In addition, user can logout if he/she are no longer want
to use.
